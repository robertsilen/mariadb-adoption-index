# Documentation


The MariaDB weighted index is calculated in [create_index.py](index/create_index.py) by fetching the monthly values, calculating their index value compared to the baseline value of 2024-01. A weighted summary index value per month is calculated as defined in [create_index_weights.csv](index/create_index_weights.csv).

The source data is fetched either with automation from their original sources (see .github/workflows/) or added manually by the MariaDB Foundation. Raw fetched data is converted to monthly values in _monthly.csv files. 

Cursor and Claude have been used to generate this solution.
